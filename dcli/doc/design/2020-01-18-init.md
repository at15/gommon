## Motivation

- cobra has some extra dependencies and does not release regularly
- want write cli in different way, e.g. use interface instead of a cobra.Command struct, real pre run and post run
- decode flag to struct

## Design

Will just start with a simple design and incomplete implementation, can solve the problem along them way

- [ ] flag, especially persistent flag is hard ...

```text
type Application struct {
    Name
    Description
    Version
}

// Command
type Command interface {
    Run(ctx context.Contxt, dctx dcli.Context) error
}

type PreCommand interface {
    PreRun() error
}

type PostCommand interface {
    PostRun() error
}

type Context {
    Cwd() string // exit if can't get current working directory
}
```

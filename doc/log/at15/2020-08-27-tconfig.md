# 2020-08-27 tconfig

## TODO

- [ ] design interface for `Value` and `Mutator`
- [ ] allow extending data type, we only support `bool`, `int`, `string` out of box

## Background

There was a config package `gommon/config` is the very beginning, it is modelled after `spf13/cobra`.
Which essentially load everything as a `map[string]interface{}` and access using `a.b.c.d`.
It supports multiple config source, e.g. merge configs from different config file `~/.foo/default.yml`, `$PWD/foo.yml`.
It's very flexible and dynamic, however the convenience comes with cost. It's hard to modify the config.
If you add/remove config value, the code can break randomly, especially when people build key path on the fly
e.g. `"foo." + var1 + ".bar"`.  instead of `foo.svc1.bar`. There is no compiler error telling you something is wrong.

So I changed to another approach, write config struct and decode from structured format like `json`, `yaml`.
This approach works fine when the config file is the only source and all the values are required in the config file.
However, once we started to consider config value override (e.g. default, multiple config sources) things become complex.
We lose the track of origin of the config value, it can be the default, a command line flag, a field in JSON,
an override in code or even a user provided input that happens to be the default.

There is a concept called [data lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage) which I first learned from @palvaro's
LDFI paper. Just like you can trace data change, micro services etc. You can also track your config change (even within a process).
Like all the tracing methods, you need to use wrapped functions (that calls trace logic underneath) 
or inject trace logic in original functions.

btw: I think it's also a bit similar to Redux and even Raft. Honestly, I feel all the applying log to get state approaches
looks similar in some extent. 

The name `tconfig` got the `t` from tracing/traceable.

## Design

There are two main use cases for config value, a single value or a set of value in a struct.
We ignore use cases like `[]Value` and `map[string]Value` because using a struct is a more type safe alternative.

A value contains a current state and a list of mutations, if the list is append only, the state is equal to
application of all the mutations in their insertion order. However, the list of mutations might get truncated
for performance reason, though in that case, chances are the package is being misused as a database.

An alternative approach is using a linked list, where each mutation points to its ancestor.
However, I think keep a slice makes traverse and print etc. faster and easier w/ native `range` support in go.

```
type Value interface {
    Eval() interface{}
}

type IntValue interface {
    EvalInt() int
}

type Mutator interface {
    MutateBool()
    MutateInt()
    MutateString()
}

type MutableValue interace {
    Mutate(m Mutator)
    Mutations() []Mutation
}
```
